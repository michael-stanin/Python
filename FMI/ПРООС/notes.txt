1. Rethink the use of the application.py module. 
 - Consider using another root object to split successfully the login frame and the menu frame and everything else.
 Thus it'll let you to use both pack() and grid() independently for each frame.
 - Or maybe just change the master for both login and menu frames to be the master of the application object instead of the application itself ? 

2. Check the example of Notebook tkinter in the chrome bookmarks... Maybe grid_row/columnconfigure would help ?
